pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open `Sentiment_Analysis_using_python_and_powerbi.ipynb`. This notebook will guide you through loading, preprocessing, analyzing sentiment, and saving the data.

2. **Run the Scripts**: Alternatively, you can run the individual scripts located in the `sentiment_analysis` directory.

## Data

The raw data file is downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140?select=training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv) and is located in the `data/raw` directory. After processing and sentiment analysis, the results are saved in the `data/processed` directory.

## Results

The final dataset with sentiment scores and labels is saved as `tweets_sentiments.csv` in the `data/processed` directory.
