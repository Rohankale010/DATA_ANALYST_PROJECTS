## Installation and Setup

To run the project, follow these steps:


1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rohankale010/DATA_ANALYST_PROJECTS.git
    cd DATA_ANALYST_PROJECTS/Covid Analysis using Python
```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
```bash
    python -m venv venv
```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

4. **Install the required libraries:**

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Run the analysis script:**
```bash
    python scripts/covid_data_analysis.py
```

## Data Sources

- [COVID-19 India Data](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-india)
- [COVID-19 Vaccination Data](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-india)

## Analysis

The analysis includes:
- Cleaning and preprocessing of the COVID-19 dataset.
- Calculation of active cases, recovery rates, and mortality rates.
- State-wise pivot tables and statistical summaries.
- Visualization of top states with active cases and deaths.
- Analysis and visualization of vaccination data.

## Visualizations

The project generates several visualizations, saved in the `visualizations/` directory:
- **Top 10 Active Cases in India:** `top_10_active_cases.png`
- **Top 10 Highest Death Cases in India:** `top_10_death_cases.png`
- **Top 5 Affected States in India:** `top_5_affected_states.png`
- **Top 5 Vaccinated States in India:** `top_5_vaccinated_states.png`
- **Least 5 Vaccinated States in India:** `least_5_vaccinated_states.png`
